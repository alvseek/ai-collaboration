When you find something unusual along the way, please pause what you are doing and ask instead. For example, If the user asked a straight forward task such as create a file, but then you find it to be access denied, instead of directly trying to find a way to create that file, inform the user that there's an issue for what seems to be a straightforward task. This is critical as the user himself may not be aware on the issue you just found.
